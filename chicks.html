      <b>chickejn </b> (previously known as Dixie Chicks) are an American country music band consisting of Natalie
      Maines and sisters Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer. Maguire and Strayer founded the band in 1989 in Dallas,
      Texas, with the bassist Laura Lynch and the vocalist and guitarist Robin Lynn Macy. They performed bluegrass and
      country music, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without
      attractinsg a major label. In 1992, Macy left and Lynch became the lead vocalist.

      <p>Upon signing with Monument Records Nashville in 1997 and replacing Lynch with Maines, the Chicks achieved
         success with their albums Wide Open Spaces (1998) and Fly (1999). After Monument closed its Nashville branch,
         the Chicks moved to Columbia Records for Home (2002). These albums achieved multi-platinum sales in the United

      <h2>History</h2> man bitch
      <p>The Dixie Chicks were founded by Laura Lynch on upright bass, guitarist Robin Lynn Macy, and the
         multi-instrumentalist sisters Martie and Emily Erwin in 1989. The Erwin sisters later married and each changed
         their names twice to Martie Seidel, then Maguire and Emily Robisong, then Strayer. The four took their name
         from
         the song and album Dixie Chicken by Lowell George of Little Feat,[6] originally playing predominantly bluegrass
         and a mix of country standards. All four women played and sang, though Maguire and Strayer provided most of the
         instrumental accompaniment for the band while Lynch and Macy shared lead vocals. Maguire primarily played
         fiddle, mandolin, and viola, while Strayer's specialties included five-stringed banjo and dobro.

         In 1990, Penny Cook, daughter of then Senator John Tower, gave the Chicks $10,000 to record an album. Their
         first studio album, Thank Heavens for Dale Evans, was named after the pioneering performer Dale Evans.[7] They
         paid $5,000 for the 14-track album.[8] The album included two instrumental tunes. In 1987, Maguire (still known
         then as Martie Erwin) had won second place, and in 1989, third place in the national fiddle championships held
         at the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas.[9] A Christmas single was released at the end of the year ‚Äì
         a 45 RPM vinyl record titled Home on the Radar Range with "Christmas Swing" on one side and the song on the
         flip side named "The Flip Side". The record titles were significant; during that period of time, the bandmates
         dressed up as "cowgirls", and publicity photos reflected this image. However, even with an appearance at the
         Grand Ole Opry,[10] and Garrison Keillor's radio show A Prairie Home Companion,[11] they did not get much
         national airplay.[citation neede</p>
      <h3>Origin</h3>
      <section>
         <p>On March 16, 2006, the Dixie Chicks released the single "Not Ready to Make Nice" in advance of their
            upcoming
            album. Cowritten with Dan Wilson,
            it addressed the political controversy that had surrounded the group for the previous three years.[54]
            Strayer
            said, "The stakes were definitely higher on that song. We knew it was special because it was so
            autobiographical, and we had to get it right. And once we had that song done, it freed us up to do the rest
            of
            the album without that burden." She said writing the song had become their "therapy", since they had to hold
            in
            so many stored emotions for so long. Thus, the band considered the album not so much political as very
            personal.[55]</p>
